.SYNOPSIS
    Backs up BitLocker recovery keys to Entra ID (Azure AD) for hybrid-joined devices.
.DESCRIPTION
    Designed to run as SYSTEM via PDQ Connect. Enumerates all BitLocker-encrypted volumes,
    finds their RecoveryPassword key protectors, and backs each one up to Entra ID.

    For hybrid-joined devices, dsregcmd must run in SYSTEM context to see the device
    registration state. This script requires Administrator or SYSTEM and exits if
    it detects it is running as a standard user.
.NOTES
    Requirements:
      - Device must be Hybrid Azure AD Joined
      - BitLocker must be enabled with a RecoveryPassword protector
      - Runs as SYSTEM (PDQ Connect default)

$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'

# --- Ensure SYSTEM context ---
# PDQ Connect runs as SYSTEM by default, but guard against manual runs.
# dsregcmd and BackupToAAD-BitLockerKeyProtector both require SYSTEM or admin context.
